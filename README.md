### Hi there, I'm Karlo.

I've always liked rusty old languages like **C** and **C++**.
But then I discovered a new language that has even more rust in it - **The Rust ðŸ¦€**.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **Rust open source projects**.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently reading books about **blockchain techonology**.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: *Discord -> `bolkonksy#0061`*
- âš¡ Fun fact: *Good code is like a poem. It's as short as it can be while anyone can still kind of understand it. Are we trying to become better poets then?*

My username was supposed to be `Random`, but then I managed to mistype it.
